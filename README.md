# BJhands
Disclaimer: This "project" is just for fun. I'm only puting my c# coding skills to the test.
This is the first version of it, where the user plays free blackjack games on whatever site he wants to play on.
Then enter his hand and the hand of the dealer before using the "basic BJ technique".
Then the program will put the information into a .csv file and/or calculate the probabilities of winning considering the wins and the losses of the user.
Of course this needs to play hundreds of BJ games thats is why the last version will focus on doing that automatically. 
But there is a long way to go : first, BJhands-v1.
